# Ziti Fabric

Ziti is a modern, programmable network overlay with associated edge components, for application-embedded, zero trust network connectivity, written by developers for developers. Ziti allows developers to take control of networking while with secure connectivity and advanced security concepts such as Zero Trust.

The Ziti Fabric implements a geo-scale routable mesh network overlay, with smart routing and dynamic healing features.
